# The Genetic Disorder Calculator 🧬

## Overview
According to Lurie Children's Hospital, 1 in 10 Americans live with a rare disease, and nearly half of them are children. Of these diseases identified, nearly 72% are genetic and the majority of these diseases (70%) start in childhood. However, such diagnoses often are unprecedented and take families by surprise. 

This web application hopes to remediate these worries by providing a low-cost and efficient way to predict the probability of offspring inheriting a particular genetic disorder based on the genetic traits of their parents, providing parents and future parents preparation before symptoms appear.
